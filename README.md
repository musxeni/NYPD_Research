# NYPD_Research
The goal of the following work was to look at which day of the week has the most crimes. I wanted to further divide it by age just
so I can view another angle of the data.
I was expecting the day of the week with the highest crimes to be a weekend or perhaps Friday. The day with the most crimes were in fact
a Wednesday. Most crimals are 25-44 years of age which makes sense.
