# NYPD_Research
The goal of the following research was to look at which day of the week has the most crimes. I wanted to further divide it by age just
so I can view another angle of the data. There is a level of interactivity that allows the user to filter the data by crime. 
This way you can see the day of the week most crimes are commited. 
I was expecting the day of the week with the highest crimes to be a weekend or perhaps Friday. The day with the most crimes were in fact
a Wednesday. Most criminals are 25-44 years of age which makes sense. 

Some intresting information per the NYPD Data Report: 

People accused of Rape are  arrested on a Tuesday.

Arson arrests also take place on a Tuesday.

Most Burglary arests take place on a Thursday.

This data is from 2021-01-01 to 2021-09-30.
